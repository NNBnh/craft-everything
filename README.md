<p align="center">The most ambitious Minecraft crafting recipes collections</p>

## About
**Craft Everything** is the biggest collections of Minecraft crafting recipes in datapacks form.

> When Minecraft was at version 1.8, I created a skyblock map called "The end of The End" (can't find that map anymore ...) in which I did a workaround of custom crafting table using villager trading to craft everything from nothing.
>
> And now in 1.16 I finally have time to rework that idea with datapacks.

###### **NOTE:** Lots of recipes are inspired or ported from Crafting Tweaks and Voodoo Packs ... see [Credit](#credit) for more details.

## Usage
This collection is split into four categories.

### Convenience
These recipes help improve quality of life, undo, convert and many more making the "junk" chest less cramped.

These recipes make crafting some of the rare items possible.
