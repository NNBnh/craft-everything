## About
**Craft Everything** is the biggest collections of Minecraft crafting recipes and loot table in datapacks form.

Eveything here is `.json` only.

> When Minecraft was at version 1.8, I created a skyblock map called "The end of The End" (can't find that map anymore ...) in which I did a workaround of custom crafting table using villager trading to craft everything from nothing.
>
> And now in 1.16 I finally have time to rework that idea with datapacks.

###### **NOTE:** Lots of recipes are inspired or ported from Crafting Tweaks, The Missing Recipes and Voodoo Packs ... see [Credit](#credit) for more details.

## Usage
This collection is split into four categories.

### Convenience
These recipes help improve quality of life, undo, convert and many more making the "junk" chest less cramped.

### Rare
These recipes make crafting some of the rare items possible.

### Element
These recipes are designed for use with skyblock map (even in Void biome) but are still convenient to have when playing normally.

### OP
These recipes make god-tier / unbreakable items craftable.
