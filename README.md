## About
**Craft Everything** is the biggest collections of Minecraft crafting recipes in datapacks form.

> When Minecraft was at version 1.8, I created a skyblock map called "The end of The End" (can't find that map anymore ...) in which I did a workaround of custom crafting table using villager trading to craft everything from nothing.
>
> And now in 1.16 I finally have time to rework that idea with datapacks.

###### **NOTE:** Lots of recipes are inspired or ported from Crafting Tweaks and Voodoo Packs ... see [Credit](#credit) for more details.
